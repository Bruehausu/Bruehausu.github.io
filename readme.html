			<h1>Me</h1>

			<p>
				My name is Guy.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am a writer, researcher, programmer, and game designer.
				I could be classified as a new media artist.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am worried about life, and people.
				I am more concerned with people and philosophy than art objects and galleries.
				I am unsure that making art for other people is morally justifiable. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I like video games. 
			</p>
